Business Problem Identification
Core Issue
The bank’s marketing campaigns have low conversion rates (only ~11% of calls result in subscriptions). Cold-calling all customers is inefficient and costly.

Key Pain Points
High Cost per Acquisition: Wasted calls to low-propensity customers.

Poor Targeting: No data-driven segmentation (e.g., retirees vs. entrepreneurs).

Ethical Risks: Potential bias against older or low-income customers.

Business Goals
Reduce Marketing Costs: Target only high-potential customers using ML.

Increase Conversion Rate: Improve precision (reduce false positives).

Ensure Fairness: Avoid excluding demographics like retirees or unemployed.

ROI Calculation Example
Assumptions:

Cost per call: $5 (labor, telecom, etc.).

Profit per converted customer: $100 (term deposit interest margin).

Current Scenario (Without ML):

Total calls: 41,188.

Conversions: 4,640 (11.3%).

Total cost: 41,188 ×

ML-Optimized Scenario (20% fewer calls, 15% higher conversions):

Reduced calls: 32,950 (80% of 41,188).

New conversions: 4,640 × 1.15 = 5,336.

Actionable Business Questions
Targeting Efficiency:

Which customer segments (job, education, age) have the highest conversion rates?

Can we reduce calls to low-propensity groups without sacrificing revenue?

Cost-Benefit Trade-offs:

Is a longer call duration (duration) correlated with higher conversions? Does this justify longer calls?

Ethical Risks:

Are older customers (age > 60) or those with job=unemployed unfairly excluded by the model?

Data Exploration & Preprocessing Steps
Handle Missing Values:

Replace “unknown” entries in job, education, etc., using MICE imputation.

Feature Engineering:

Create call_efficiency = duration / campaign (higher = more effective calls).

Derive financial_stability = balance – housing_loan.

EDA:

Plot conversion rates by job and education.

Check correlation between duration and y (risk: longer calls may coerce subscriptions).

Analyze class imbalance: Only 11.3% conversions (address with SMOTE or class weights).

Ethical Risk Mitigation
Bias Audit:

Use SHAP to check if age or job unfairly impact predictions.

Apply AIF360 to measure demographic parity (e.g., conversion rate parity for age > 60).

Debiasing:

Reweight classes for underrepresented groups.

Include fairness constraints during model training (e.g., adversarial debiasing).

# AI-Driven Marketing Optimization for Bank Term Deposits  
## Problem Statement  
Inefficient cold-calling wastes $205K annually. A precision-optimized ML model will target high-potential customers, reducing costs and increasing conversions.  

## Expected ROI  
- **Cost Reduction**: $41,190 (20% fewer calls).  
- **Revenue Gain**: $69,600 (15% more conversions).  
- **Total Impact**: **$110,790/year**.  

## Risks & Mitigation  
1. **Bias Against Older Customers**: Regular fairness audits with SHAP.  
2. **Overfitting to Call Duration**: Exclude `duration` if ethically questionable.  

## Next Steps  
1. Train XGBoost model with Optuna for precision.  
2. Deploy as a Dockerized API for real-time predictions.  
3. Monitor bias quarterly with AIF360.  
Recruiter-Focused Takeaways
Technical Skills: MICE imputation, SHAP, Optuna, Docker.

Business Impact: $110K+ annual profit gain.

Ethical AI: Proactive bias mitigation.
